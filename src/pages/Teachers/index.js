                    Wave Learning Festival is an educational platform organized by students at 
                    Harvard, Stanford, Northwestern, UPenn, Williams, RISD, and SLO in which college 
                    students teach completely free seminars on a variety of topics to middle and high 
                    schoolers online.

                    The global pandemic has changed what education and summer programs look like, 
                    and in some cases, completely shut them down. We hope that by providing fun 
                    and diverse live classes, we can help students to continue learning, stay 
                    engaged, and interact with others while stuck at home. We also hope to 
                    alleviate some of the new burdens that have fallen on parents who no longer 
                    have summer programs to keep their children busy while they work full-time. 
                    For a few hours each day, they can take a break and get their work done without 
                    having to worry.

                    <h1>Apply by 5/29 to be included in the second wave!</h1>
                    <p>
                    Due to overwhelming interest in teaching, we have closed applications to the first wave 
                    early in the interest of keeping our inaugural cohort small. If you haven't heard back 
                    from us yet, we will be reaching out soon to include you in our expanded second wave. 
                    Thank you for your patience!
                    </p>
