                    <Typography.BodyText>Not at all. Anyone can take any class they are interested in. It may be helpful to have some background in certain subjects before taking certain classes, but there is no formal requirement.</Typography.BodyText>

However, if a class is overbooked, we may prioritize students that are not yet enrolled in others.
