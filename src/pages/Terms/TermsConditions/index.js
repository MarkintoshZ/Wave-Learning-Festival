                    <h2>Warranties:</h2>
                    <p>
                        You hereby acknowledge that you are using the Services at your own risk. The Services and content
                        are provided “as is,” and WLF, its affiliates, and its third party service providers hereby disclaim
                        any and all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to any warranties of accuracy,
                        reliability, merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, and any other
                        warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, express or implied, whether oral, in writing, or in
                        electronic form. WLF, its affiliates, and its third-party service providers do not represent or
                        warrant that access to the Services will be uninterrupted or that there will be no failures, errors,
                        or omissions or loss of transmitted information, or that no viruses or other malware will be transmitted
                        through the Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because some states do not permit disclaimer of implied warranties, you may have
                        additional consumer rights under your local laws.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Limitation of Liability:</h2>
                    <p>

                        waiver of any other term or condition. Similarly, any failure of WLF to assert
                        a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right
                        or provision.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assignment:</h2>

Subject to an assignment or transfer to another party, these Terms will bind the party, their successors and permitted assigns. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than parties explicitly stated.</p>
                    <h2>Governing Law:</h2>

If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of WLF, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
