                  <b>Teacher Bio: </b> I am currently an incoming senior at Gunn High School (class of 2021) and mythology has long been a passion of mine. I was interested in finding connections between all the stories and better understanding what those connections told us about the respective societies. I hoped others would be curious as well!
