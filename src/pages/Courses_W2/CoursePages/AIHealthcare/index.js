            AI in Healthcare serves as an introduction to how Artificial
            Intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry. It will cover
            the basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the
            history behind it, and some of the mathematical techniques used in
            the algorithms. It will explore the applications of AI in healthcare
            ranging from AI Robot-assisted surgery to automating processes in
            healthcare like tracking hospital waiting times while prioritizing
            patient illnesses. Finally, it will walk you through high-level
            steps on how one can create an AI-based application to predict
            cancer using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas.

            <b>Teacher Bio: </b> I am a rising junior at Palo Alto High School,
            California. I love learning and spreading my knowledge to others. I
            will be teaching a class on Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. I
            am very passionate about STEM and have been conducting research in
            Biology, Computer Science, and Math since middle school. I am very
            curious about Artificial Intelligence because it is improving the
            way we live our lives in many ways from bridging language barriers
            to transforming governments. AI is also making giant strides in the
            healthcare field from predicting early onset of disorders like
            diabetic retinopathy to accelerating drug discovery for treating
            COVID-19. I hope to share my knowledge about AI and healthcare with
            you. I have gained my knowledge from taking courses and by
            performing research in these areas. I have also enriched my
            understanding by developing AI curriculum and leading AI workshops
            for people with disabilities. I have taught programming to kids of
            all ages at several libraries in my community. In my free time, I
            enjoy reading and playing chamber music with friends.
