                <h1>Developing Solutions to Tackle the Climate Crisis</h1>
                  <p>
                In many ways, the 2015 Paris Agreement marked a turning point in international efforts to combat climate change. Yet, even with growing momentum for corporations and governments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, much progress still needs to be made. A team of researchers based out of MIT and Climate Interactive recently developed the Climate EN-ROADS climate change solutions simulator, which allows users to test the carbon emissions reduction potential of different climate change solutions. In this course, we will have the opportunity to learn how different climate change mitigation solutions stack up against each other as we try to decarbonize our global economy to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

                  <b>Teacher Bio: </b>My name is Charles Hua, and I'm a rising junior at Harvard College (Class of 2022) majoring in Statistics and Math with a minor in Energy and Environment. I'm deeply passionate about sustainability and climate change; having grown up in the Midwest (specifically Madison, Wisconsin), I hold a deep appreciation for nature and sustainability. At Harvard, I'm involved in environmental consulting and serve on a subcommittee of the Presidential Committee on Sustainability, and in high school, I helped raise $150,000 to install solar panels at my high school. On campus, I'm involved in environmental consulting, radio broadcasting, student managing for the basketball team, and photography. In my free time, I enjoy trying new restaurants, playing basketball, watching Netflix, and listening to podcasts.
